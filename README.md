# E-commerce Website Testing with Cypress

This repository contains automated tests for an e-commerce website using the **Cypress** framework. The testing suite is designed to ensure the functionality, performance, and reliability of the website. Advanced testing concepts like **Page Object Model (POM)**, **XPath selectors**, and **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration (CI) have been implemented.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure using the **Page Object Model (POM)** pattern to promote reusability and maintainability of the code.

```
/cypress
  /fixtures    # Stores test data files
  /integration # Test files (organized by features or pages)
  /pages       # Page Object Model files
  /plugins     # Cypress plugins
  /support     # Custom commands and support files
```

## Features

- **Automation Framework**: Built on Cypress for end-to-end testing.
- **Advanced Selectors**: Uses **XPath** for selecting dynamic elements.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Organizes test code into reusable page objects, making the tests more maintainable and scalable.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Integrated with **GitHub Actions** to automatically run tests on each commit.
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Tests can be run across different browsers supported by Cypress.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Cypress dashboard and Mocha reports are available to track test execution.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- Git
- Cypress (latest version)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-testing.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd ecommerce-testing
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running Tests

#### Locally

To run tests locally, use the following command:

```bash
npx cypress open
```

This will open the Cypress Test Runner, where you can choose the test files to run.

#### Headless Mode

To run tests in headless mode (for faster execution), use the following command:

```bash
npx cypress run
```

#### Using GitHub Actions

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically runs tests on each push or pull request. The configuration file is located at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

You can monitor test results from the **Actions** tab on your GitHub repository.

### Test Scenarios

The following key functionalities of the e-commerce website are covered:

- User authentication (sign-up, login, logout)
- Product browsing and search functionality
- Adding/removing items to/from the cart
- Checkout process
- Payment integration testing
- Order history and user account management

### XPath Selectors

For dynamic elements where traditional CSS selectors may not be reliable, **XPath** selectors have been implemented. An example of an XPath selector in Cypress:

```javascript
cy.xpath('//button[text()="Add to Cart"]').click();
```

### Page Object Model (POM)

The **Page Object Model** pattern is used to separate the test scripts from the page-specific logic, allowing easy maintenance of the code. Example:

```javascript
// productPage.js
class ProductPage {
  addToCart() {
    cy.xpath('//button[text()="Add to Cart"]').click();
  }
}

export default ProductPage;
```

### Reporting

Test results are displayed in the Cypress Dashboard for visual feedback. Additionally, Mocha reports are generated and can be found in the `reports` folder after test execution.

### CI/CD with GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is configured to run the Cypress tests automatically in a CI pipeline. The configuration file `.github/workflows/ci.yml` includes steps for:

- Installing dependencies
- Running tests in headless mode
- Generating reports
